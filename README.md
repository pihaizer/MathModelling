Lab solution for math modelling consists of 3 projects:
1. Random generation of a two-component value given it's probability matrix
2. Queue system with multiple workers, varying queue size, given people income density, 
process time density, avetage wait time before going away. 
Produces a bunch of analyzed parameters and charts.
3. Queue system similar to 2-nd project with a single worker and infinite queue size, 
process time is generated using Erland distribution.
